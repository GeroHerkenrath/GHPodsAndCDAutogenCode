# Example project to demonstrate a potential bug in cocoapods #

To run the project download it and execute `pod install` in the project folder (pod files are ignored in the project).

The chosen pods are just there for completeness' sake and are not actually used in the project.
Since the purpose is showing a linker issue, the app doesn't do anything, in fact.

On checkout the project does link correctly, see the `README-autogenerated-files` file for instructions
on how to see the error. The file is added to the Xcode project (but not member of a target) and in the
`GHPodsAndCDAutogenCode - Core Data Autogenerated` groups.

Note that regular template projects created with Xcode 8.1 will _not_ link correctly when core data automated
subclass generation is used. I just didn't want to check in a broken version without also showing a workaround for now.
